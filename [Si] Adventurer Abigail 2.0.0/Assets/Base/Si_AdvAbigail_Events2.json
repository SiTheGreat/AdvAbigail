What if they can't understand?', f 'they don't have to understand just to be there for you/give them some credit, I'm sure they'll do their best for you', a ..., a 'you're right, I've been trying to go through all this alone to prove to myself that i can do it, but that doesn't mean I can't ask my friends to support me. I'd xo the same for them!', f :), a 'just... let's save telling my parents for another time, alright?
